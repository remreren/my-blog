Before diving into the topic, let me explain the library example I'll be using to help you better understand the subject. Our library application encompasses four services: book service, author service, user service, and loan service. Let's assume the user base of this application is large, with the book service being used more frequently and the loan service being used less frequently.

To deeply understand a topic, we need to start from the very beginning. So, let's begin with the meaning of the word monolith. The word monolith is derived from Latin, combining “single” and “stone.” The term was chosen because it signifies something solid and unified, like a rock.

![Simple Layered Architecture](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:648/format:webp/1*Mtl0XwjaMRWfdZGW5haHvQ.png#small)

As mentioned above, we can think of monolithic architecture as applications where all services are combined into one. In monolithic systems, we package and present all services like the user interface service, book service, and author service within a single package.

Monolithic systems are the easiest to develop. Nowadays, with the help of libraries and software frameworks we have, we can quickly roll out applications. For example, we can launch the first version of a pre-planned application using monolithic architecture in as little as a week.

Another ease of monolithic systems is their testing. Since monolithic services run as a single package, unlike microservices architecture, we do not have to test inter-service communication.

The last advantage of monolithic systems mentioned in this article is the ease of scaling. If you write an application and install it on multiple computers, you can consider your system horizontally scaled. Although you might face a bottleneck with the database in the future, in the short term, you will have scaled quite rapidly.

Although monolithic systems offer many advantages, they also have significant disadvantages when we think on a larger scale.

The primary disadvantage is the difficulty in developing applications for advanced applications/large teams. For example, your application grows, and you are trying to increase the features in your system, or your existing team can no longer keep up with your development speed. In such a case, hiring new employees might be a good idea. If you have a monolithic architecture, everything needs to be worked on a single application, i.e., a single codebase, which means you cannot effectively divide into small teams. Therefore, hiring a new employee might not solve your problem and may even complicate it.

![No Asynchronous Development](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1352/format:webp/1*wZN8b-nNrl0HLE2aG7rK7A.png#small)

In monolithic systems, all units are tightly coupled, so there will inevitably be problems in developing this structure in large teams.

Additionally, if an error occurs in a single service, the entire application crashes. Even if the application’s startup time is short, encountering such a problem can cause you significant losses.

When we have multiple services, we might want to scale them based on their usage. Referring to the example at the beginning of the article, the book service is used more frequently than the loan service. In a system using monolithic architecture, since the book service and loan service are on a single application, we cannot scale these services separately. This leads to unnecessary costs.

![Scaling-up Monolithic Architecture](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*ZxAAsb7k2OTtPtn334v_EQ.png#small)

Another disadvantage of the monolithic structure is the difficulties in deployment. Since our application is in a single package, the application needs to be entirely shut down during updates. This can negatively impact the user experience.

As we see in monolithic systems, the bigger the system gets, the more the problems grow. To cope with these issues, we need to break down growing systems into smaller pieces. If you can divide a system into more manageable pieces and make synchronous tasks asynchronous, you will find that the system operates faster, and the work progresses more quickly.

![Divide and Conquer](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*YMVltBR2GN5Bm_nrjEDfgw.png#small)

To give another example, individuals are weak on their own. They later realize they are stronger together and form groups based on their interests. As the group grows, internal conflicts increase, management becomes difficult, and people’s interests begin to clash. Consequently, groups tend to form sub-groups. Once divided into smaller groups, they start working faster and are easier to manage. In computer science, this is called the divide and conquer technique. When we divide a problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, the ease and speed of solving the problem increase.

This is where microservices come into play. We can create microservices by breaking down large, single-piece, and hard-to-manage services into smaller, autonomous parts and manage them more easily.

![Scaling-up Concept on Microservices Architecture](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*W-75wQjIhIAyeJ4dWtKC8w.png#small)

Various methods are used to break large systems into microservices. In our example, we decided to group services that work on similar data. In the book microservice, features like listing books, saving books, and showing a book with its author are grouped, while in the author microservice, features like searching for authors, saving authors, and listing authors are grouped.

For instance, when we call the service to show a book with its author, we cannot obtain the author within the book microservice. When we want to obtain the author within the book microservice, it is not desirable because we fall into code duplication and go beyond microservice boundaries. Therefore, we need to request the author from the author microservice.

As you can see, in such cases, the concept of communication between microservices arises. How do two microservices communicate with each other? Through the internet, of course! Various protocols can be used for communication, but the two most popular ones are RESTful and gRPC. These two microservices exchange the data they need through these protocols.

Now that we have mostly covered the innovations brought by the microservice structure, let's move on to the advantages of microservices. The first advantage is that microservices are entirely independent of each other. Independent services can operate autonomously. An error in one microservice does not affect the others. When we want to start or update a microservice, we do not have to stop and update the entire application; we can package and deploy just one microservice.

Another feature of microservices' independence is that each microservice can be owned by a small team. If you use microservice infrastructure and work with a large team, you can divide this team into smaller parts and have them work completely independently. This approach adds asynchronous working capability to the project and significantly speeds it up. This is one of the most important features in terms of project development.

![Sample Release Diagram](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*tNMO0HNtsIkB275dTwt8Ug.png#small)

Another advantage of the microservice structure is the ability to scale services individually. For example, we have a project with three microservices. One of these microservices is used much more than the others. Instead of duplicating the entire application in monolithic architecture and wasting resources, we can scale the most used microservice more than the others, preventing unnecessary resource wastage and avoiding excessive scaling.

![Scaling-up Microservice Architecture](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*777FOE_5BCD8gcXwAHmrIA.png#small)

Another advantage of microservices is that if a platform-independent communication protocol is used, each microservice can be written in a different language. For example, while framework x provides better performance for one microservice, framework y may offer better performance for another microservice. These two separate microservices can communicate freely, regardless of which language or software framework they use.

![Platform Independent Communication](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*2rKUET_OILGTge19sBI0kQ.png#small)

Although microservices solve many problems compared to monolithic services, they also bring many issues. The first and most important is the learning curve. When taking the first step, you will encounter many problems, i.e., when you try to set up the system for the first time, you will face many challenges. But once you succeed in setting up the system, the job becomes a real piece of cake.

Another issue in systems using microservice architecture is container management and health monitoring. Since we have many small microservice instances, their management cannot be done manually. After solving the container management problem, the issue of monitoring their health arises. If even a single microservice instance is not working correctly, we cannot say that our system is operating at full efficiency, which causes us financial losses.

The third problem we will discuss regarding microservices is network latency. Normally, communication done within a single computer has to be done between computers/containers when we switch to microservice architecture. Therefore, the losses that occur in packing and transmitting data from one computer to another manifest as network latency.

As you can see, both architectures have their pros and cons. For example, monolithic architecture is quite useful for small projects and teams, but as the team and project grow, the advantages of microservices start to increase. Whether you use monolithic or microservices architecture, if you have built a quality structure, you can run your team in parallel and get good efficiency. However, if your user base has expanded and your team's efficiency has decreased, switching to microservices architecture might be a good choice.
